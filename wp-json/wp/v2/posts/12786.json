The bar of the Esplanade Hotel has an almost century-old tradition and attracts guests from all over the world, as well as Zagreb locals, but our goal was to raise the popularity of choosing a hotel bar for a night out with friends, through a creative and playful offer of cocktails. During my years of working in bars, I have noticed that many guests do not want to or cannot drink alcohol for various reasons &#8211; from health and religious reasons, to alcohol just not fitting into their lifestyle. There were guests who were not allowed to drink alcohol temporarily, but still would have preferred to drink something more than just plain juice, coffee, or a sugar-syrup combination. And this is where non-alcoholic and low-alcohol cocktails, known in the world as LABV cocktails, enter the picture. I have studied our offer in detail and carefully created these cocktails, finding and combining different ingredients so that they would truly contain only healthy nutrients, while at the same time being tasty, refreshing, interesting, and visually attractive. Finally, I achieved what I envisioned, which are truly well-being cocktails, to which I also added a theatrical touch in how they are served, so that the guests could enjoy the entire experience,&#8221; said<\/em> <strong>Vjenceslav Madi\u0107<\/strong> &#8211; <strong>Master Kishoni<\/strong>, adding: &#8220;<em>The new line of cocktails brings sensational combinations of organic ingredients, they are made with no or little alcohol, without sugar and gluten, with completely natural and aromatic flavours, with the base being the fine non-alcoholic Mediterranean distilled aromatic water MeMento, dedicated to mixology and natural cold-pressed juices with a vegan certificate. I can say that non-alcoholic cocktails also have a detox effect and are super nutritious for the body because they are abundant in natural juices that contain high-value nutrients, vitamins, and minerals.&#8221;<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In addition to carefully selected ingredients and interesting combinations, these cocktails are unique for their <strong>distinctive preparation and the direct communication involved between the bartender and the guest <\/strong>. &#8220;<em>Nowadays, everyone is looking for something different and is ready to treat themselves to a unique experience, while at the same time learning something new. Therefore, and specially for this line of cocktails, I designed a ritual in which the bartender comes to the table and dedicates him- or herself to the guest and the preparation of the cocktail, while adding a theatrical touch with smoky, bubbly, and scented effects. Guests love it when you are fully dedicated to them, when you do something unexpected, especially today when everyone is sharing content on social networks. I believe these cocktails will be a sensation. Everyone is invited to visit the Esplanade bar and experience something truly refreshing and new,&#8221;<\/em> Vjenceslav said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Vjenceslav sets new trends in mixology and raises the iconic Esplanade 1925 Lounge &amp; Cocktail Bar to a new level with a theatrical approach to enjoying cocktails and a unique line of <strong>non-alcoholic and LABV cocktails, <\/strong>with an emphasis on carefully selected ingredients<strong>. Smoked Margarita<\/strong> delights with its combination of Mediterranean distilled aromatic water, fresh cold-pressed juice of pomegranate, celery, and apple, all of which are particularly nutritious, with the addition of organic agave syrup and berry flavour, rounding off the story with an effective smoke cloud that gives off a special aroma &#8211; this pink cocktail is a sure-fire hit. <strong>Green Bloody Mary<\/strong> is reminiscent of the original version of the cocktail. It contains green Tabasco sauce and &lt;\/767&gt; and super nutritious ingredients that wake up the body, like fresh cold-pressed juice of mint, fennel, lemon, ginger, celery, parsley, and apples without added sugar, which is why the cocktail is a real vitamin bomb, ideal for a detox. With the striking addition of organically produced extra virgin olive oil NAI 3.3 \u00a0from the island of Dugi Otok, this cocktail takes on a completely new dimension, and is served with home-made aromatic salty sticks with black sesame. <strong>Ramos Esplanade Fizz<\/strong> contains organic coconut cream, tonic based on quinine aroma, Supasawa citrus, chickpea juice, rose lemonade, and aromatic water \u2013 this interesting blend delights with its flavour, reminding us of an exotic trip. <strong>Collection of LABV cocktails<\/strong> affords the experience of a classic cocktail, but with a low alcohol content, as well as an excellent combination of natural ingredients. <strong>Megroni<\/strong> and <strong>Americano Lemonade<\/strong> contain Savoia Americano Rosso Aperitivo, which is actually a vegan aperitif made with 100% natural ingredients and Marsala wine, aged in oak barrels for 14 months, based on the historical 1897 recipe \u201cBitter Milano\u201d. It is flavoured with more than 20 hand-picked herbs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Along with cocktails, the guests at the presentation could taste a selection of delicious snacks prepared by <strong>Chef Ana Grgi\u0107 Tomi\u0107<\/strong>, while the hotel&#8217;s p\u00e2tissier team prepared delicious and arty desserts to round off the cocktail drinking experience. The atmosphere was inspired by an excellent selection of music by <strong>DJ Jurki.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>About Vjenceslav Madi\u0107, Bar Manager<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Talented mixologist Vjenceslav Madi\u0107 started working at the Esplanade Bar in 2022 as Bar Manager.
