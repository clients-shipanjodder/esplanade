She carefully combined selected ingredients into tempting, modern, and tasty dishes while respecting their original taste, giving each one her signature twist.\u00a0<b>A new divine symphony of scrumptious flavours such as chestnut cream, parsley powder, smoked mussels, bisque with saffron\u00a0<\/b>and\u00a0<b>cognac jelly &#8211; just one part of Ana\u2019s story that tempts the palette.<\/b><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>&#8220;I am delighted to have launched a new menu at Zinfandel&#8217;s. My team and I worked a lot on it, and so I believe that our guests and true gourmands will be happy with it. I used seasonal ingredients as much as possible, trying to achieve unique flavours by preparing a lot of the dishes in my own workshop whilst applying special techniques. For example, the tasty\u00a0<\/i><b>salted red beet<\/b><i>, which in this menu pairs with<\/i><b>\u00a0juicy American striploin steak<\/b><i>, we keep in salt for three days until all the liquid is drained, which causes the beet to take on a special sweet-salty taste. On the other hand,\u00a0<\/i><b>we bake the celery in salt\u00a0<\/b><i>to prevent it from drying out and to preserve all the juices. We make\u00a0<\/i><b>pine oil\u00a0<\/b><i>ourselves by cooking pine needles in sous vide, vacuum-packed with olive oil \u2013 in this way, the oil takes on the taste of pine and gives off a special wintery aromatic note.\u00a0<\/i><b>I roast scallops in grape seed oil<\/b><i>, which in combination with J<\/i><b>erusalem artichoke soup<\/b><i>\u00a0produces a a truly unique flavour. I included among the main dishes\u00a0<\/i><b>Guinea fowl breasts,<\/b><i>\u00a0which we stuff under the skin with<\/i><b>\u00a0fine cream of butter, porcini mushrooms and truffles<\/b><i>\u00a0to maintain the meat\u2019s juiciness. The\u00a0<\/i><b>deer is<\/b><i>\u00a0served with a\u00a0<\/i><b>thick port sauce\u00a0<\/b><i>which we start preparing by first\u00a0<\/i><b>smoking cherries<\/b><i>\u00a0which we then cook in port with anise, cinnamon, and cloves &#8211; this combination with venison is amazing. We are also happy to prepare homemade\u00a0<\/i><b>bread with homemade yeast\u00a0<\/b><i>cultivated by my team. For guests\u00a0<\/i><b>we also bake home-made focaccia<\/b><i>, with added rosemary, herbs, and olive oil, so as to highlight the cuisine&#8217;s Mediterranean concept. In addition, we serve guests\u00a0<\/i><b>butter that we churn ourselves<\/b><i>, enriching its flavour by adding olives and black salt,\u201d said E<\/i><b>splanade Executive Chef Ana Grgi\u0107 Tomi\u0107,<\/b><i>\u00a0adding: &#8220;When creating a menu, I am particularly attentive to choosing the right ingredients, sustainability, and maximum usability. We are committed to this because I believe that we chefs, as representatives of gastronomy, must streamline the public and the media towards the global problem of usability and food waste. We have recently received a great acknowledgment from\u00a0<b>Michelin<\/b>, which recognised our efforts in that area and awarded\u00a0<b>Zinfandel&#8217;s restaurant its first green star.<\/b>\u00a0We are very proud of this achievement and intend to dedicate ourselves even more profoundly to waste reduction in cooperation with\u00a0<b>partners from WWF<\/b>, as well as to the education of our staff and guests, and even the cultivation of some of our own ingredients.
