Some foreign guests even come to Zagreb only to enjoy this dish. The \u0161trukli are delicious and tasty, simply irresistible, and they find their way onto the menu of almost every important celebration and anniversary. January is the ideal time, and true hedonists have been contacting us for days to book their table and indulge in this perfect comfort food, with which we usually recommend a glass of premium or sparkling wine<\/em>\u201d, said <strong>Le Bistro&#8217;s Manager Ivan Trbu\u0161i\u0107. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Esplanade <em>\u0161trukli<\/em> <strong>are hand made<\/strong> with <strong>just a few fresh ingredients,<\/strong> according to <strong>the same tried and tested recipe,<\/strong> <strong>one over half a century old,<\/strong> which is why they are especially valued.<em> \u0160trukli<\/em> are made daily at the hotel\u2019s pastry shop and are synonymous with the tradition and quality of the local gourmet offer. <strong>The dough is kneaded and stretched across the entire table<\/strong> until it becomes paper-thin. It is then filled with <strong>fresh cheese<\/strong>, and the <em>\u0161trukli<\/em> are shaped with a <strong>thin porcelain plate<\/strong>, to then be <strong>steamed<\/strong>, carefully placed in a ceramic dish, topped with <strong>fine cream, and crisped in the oven<\/strong> until golden brown. Guests consume them as an appetizer, as a main course with a pinch salt, or as a dessert with sugar<em>. \u201cWe serve \u0161trukli to our guests for breakfast along with other local products such as Drni\u0161 prosciutto, Pag Island cheese, home-made cracklings, olive oil, and local sparkling wine from Ple\u0161ivica. They are the most delicious part of almost every important event, disappearing in no time. However, it is the iconic Le Bistro which has the strongest link with this specialty,&#8221; <\/em>said <strong>Executive Chef of the Esplanade&#8217;s kitchen Ana Grgi\u0107 Tomi\u0107<\/strong><em>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This traditional speciality from the Croatian Zagorje region, created in a hilly landscape of picturesque pastures and fields, has earned its undisputed place in the culinary selection of the Esplanade Hotel from the very beginning. <em>\u0160trukli<\/em> were<strong> first<\/strong> <strong>prepared at the Esplanade Hotel back in 1951,<\/strong> and it all started with the idea to offer visitors and international <strong>guests at gala festivities something appealing, authentic, and taste-tested, from different Croatian regions<\/strong>. The chefs recognised the value of national dishes as the most attractive invitation for guests who like to enjoy local delicacies, and <em>\u0161trukli <\/em>have ever since become a staple classic of each of the Esplanade\u2019s menus. Making the journey from vernacular cuisine to elite restaurants, this delicious dish has reached the very top of the offer thanks to the fact that it is handmade, its quality, fresh ingredients, and place within local tradition. The Esplanade&#8217;s <em>\u0161trukli <\/em>have also been tasted by numerous famous guests, including foreign dignitaries, members of royal families, athletes, actors, singers and others, who were never left indifferent to this traditional delicacy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The special offer of the <strong>Esplanade \u0160trukli Days<\/strong> lasts <strong>from 6 to 31 January 2023<\/strong>, and refers exclusively to consumption of <strong>two portions of oven-crisped <em>\u0161trukli<\/em><\/strong> in the restaurant <strong>Le Bistro<\/strong> at the promotional price <strong>of \u20ac16 <\/strong>(HRK 120,55).
