She carefully combined selected ingredients into tempting, modern, and tasty dishes while respecting their original taste, giving each one her signature twist.\u00a0<strong>A new divine symphony of scrumptious flavours such as chestnut cream, parsley powder, smoked mussels, bisque with saffron\u00a0<\/strong>and\u00a0<strong>cognac jelly &#8211; just one part of Ana\u2019s story that tempts the palette.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;I am delighted to have launched a new menu at Zinfandel&#8217;s. My team and I worked a lot on it, and so I believe that our guests and true gourmands will be happy with it. I used seasonal ingredients as much as possible, trying to achieve unique flavours by preparing a lot of the dishes in my own workshop whilst applying special techniques. For example, the tasty\u00a0<strong>salted red beet<\/strong>, which in this menu pairs with<strong>\u00a0juicy American striploin steak<\/strong>, we keep in salt for three days until all the liquid is drained, which causes the beet to take on a special sweet-salty taste. On the other hand,\u00a0<strong>we bake the celery in salt\u00a0<\/strong>to prevent it from drying out and to preserve all the juices. We make\u00a0<strong>pine oil\u00a0<\/strong>ourselves by cooking pine needles in sous vide, vacuum-packed with olive oil \u2013 in this way, the oil takes on the taste of pine and gives off a special wintery aromatic note.\u00a0<strong>I roast scallops in grape seed oil<\/strong>, which in combination with J<strong>erusalem artichoke soup<\/strong>\u00a0produces a a truly unique flavour. I included among the main dishes\u00a0<strong>Guinea fowl breasts,<\/strong>\u00a0which we stuff under the skin with<strong>\u00a0fine cream of butter, porcini mushrooms and truffles<\/strong>\u00a0to maintain the meat\u2019s juiciness. The\u00a0<strong>deer is<\/strong>\u00a0served with a\u00a0<strong>thick port sauce\u00a0<\/strong>which we start preparing by first\u00a0<strong>smoking cherries<\/strong>\u00a0which we then cook in port with anise, cinnamon, and cloves &#8211; this combination with venison is amazing. We are also happy to prepare homemade\u00a0<strong>bread with homemade yeast\u00a0<\/strong>cultivated by my team. For guests\u00a0<strong>we also bake home-made focaccia<\/strong>, with added rosemary, herbs, and olive oil, so as to highlight the cuisine&#8217;s Mediterranean concept. In addition, we serve guests\u00a0<strong>butter that we churn ourselves<\/strong>, enriching its flavour by adding olives and black salt,\u201d said E<\/em><strong>splanade Executive Chef Ana Grgi\u0107 Tomi\u0107,<\/strong><em>\u00a0adding: &#8220;When creating a menu, I am particularly attentive to choosing the right ingredients, sustainability, and maximum usability. We are committed to this because I believe that we chefs, as representatives of gastronomy, must streamline the public and the media towards the global problem of usability and food waste. We have recently received a great acknowledgment from\u00a0<strong>Michelin<\/strong>, which recognised our efforts in that area and awarded\u00a0<strong>Zinfandel&#8217;s restaurant its first green star.<\/strong>\u00a0We are very proud of this achievement and intend to dedicate ourselves even more profoundly to waste reduction in cooperation with\u00a0<strong>partners from WWF<\/strong>, as well as to the education of our staff and guests, and even the cultivation of some of our own ingredients. On the\u00a0<strong>Oleander Terrace<\/strong>, for the time being, we grow our own herbs and peppers and Zinfandel grapes, which gave us the first bottles of wine carrying our own label a few years after planting, in cooperation with the Krauthaker winery.\u201d\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The menu still features faithful Zinfandel&#8217;s classics such as hand-chopped\u00a0<strong>steak tartare<\/strong>\u00a0which is prepared from the best parts of the meat and selected spices,\u00a0<strong>wild sea bass roasted in salt, Istrian fu\u017ei with truffles, Caesar salad<\/strong>, and the iconic\u00a0<strong>Esplanade \u0161trukli<\/strong>\u00a0oven-crisped with cream, that also come in a\u00a0<strong>gluten-free variant<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The sweet list of desserts, which includes homemade<strong>\u00a0zlevanka<\/strong>\u00a0cornbread with poppy, grape mousse with\u00a0<strong>rose water\u00a0<\/strong>panna cotta, buckwheat\u00a0<strong>mille-feuille<\/strong>\u00a0in peanut butter cream with\u00a0<strong>Tonka<\/strong>\u00a0bean foam, and juicy caramelised quince and yuzu with lime, completes Ana\u2019s creative winter story.\u00a0<strong>Zinfandel&#8217;s wine list<\/strong>\u00a0has been refreshened with some new interesting labels of wines, champagnes, and dessert wines from Croatia and the world. The wines were attentively selected by the sommelier to perfectly complement the menu.<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Zinfandel&#8217;s, with its magical Oleander Terrace and its city views, is a place of exceptional decadence created by Ana&#8217;s creative menus, but also by the people, the service \u2013 professional, affordable, and friendly &#8211; that makes our guests always happy to return&#8221;,\u00a0<\/em>added\u00a0<strong>Stjepan Okun, Maitre d &#8216; of the Zinfandel&#8217;s restaurant<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A blend of innovative approach and creative dish design, charming and professional service, sophisticated fine dining experience and art d\u00e9co atmosphere, undoubtedly place the Esplanade\u2019s Zinfandel&#8217;s at the very top of the local culinary scene.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The \u00e0 la carte offer is available every day for lunch and dinner from noon to 11 pm.
