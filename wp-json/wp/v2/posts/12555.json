While designing the new collection, I researched the offer on the market and carefully selected ingredients that I then tried to meticulously combine into refreshing, tempting, contemporary, and, above all, delicious dishes. Special attention was given to ingredients\u2019 sustainability and minimum processing so as to have them preserve their authentic taste. So, for example, I will use a carrot completely, making juice and powder from it. I use both the zucchini fruit and the flower, I use bones to prepare velout\u00e9, and I don&#8217;t throw away the shrimp shells, but rather boil them into a fine stock that I use for bisque soup that I then enrich with aromatic saffron, orange, marinated red mullet, smoked mussels, and garlic gel. I must admit that I am very pleased with this menu and I believe that the guests will like it,\u201d\u00a0<\/i>the\u00a0<b>Executive Chef Ana Grgi\u0107 Tomi\u0107\u00a0<\/b><i>said, adding: &#8220;Among my menu favourites, I would definitely highlight the Kvarner Bay scampi coming from the Velebit channel. This time, I\u2019m serving them with flower powder and a sauce made from carrot juice and bee pollen, which is extremely healthy and nutritious and soothes the nervous system. I decorated many dishes with wonderful edible flowers from local Family Farm, as such giving them a fragrant summer note. Summer is the season of tomatoes, and this time I decided to serve them as a refreshing consomm\u00e9 along with fresh basil and fleur de sel. I found excellent tomatoes at a nearby family farm that grows 80 types of excellent, sweet, juicy and completely different tomatoes. For consomm\u00e9, I used tomatoes of the oxheart variety &#8211; first I roast them, then extract the juice, then fry them and then boil for 4-5 hours to get the most intense aroma, while I serve the strained soup with basil and fresh cherry tomatoes. This time I made gnudi with young goat&#8217;s cheese from a local farmer and served them with sea urchin &#8211; it is a very simple dish with intense aromas. I combine poached John Dory fillet with a cream of lovage, which I simmer in fish stock, and marinated white asparagus, which I cook in sous vide in acacia juice with soy milk to bring out their bitterness. I stuff fresh zucchini flowers with foamy aromatic truffle cream and serve them with poached egg yolk. It&#8217;s the season of young red beet &#8211; I used them to make homemade marmalade, which I boiled for 12 hours and mixed with herbs, balsamic vinegar, and olive oil and served with American striploin steak, pine oil, pine nuts, and black garlic. Another summer favourite and a really refreshing summer dish are marinated scallops, this time served with apricot cream, apple cider vinegar, and peach tartare, along with light yogurt and elderberry pearls made with liquid nitrogen. You\u2019ll find a somewhat more intense and aromatic summer flavour in a dessert which perfectly combines bitter chocolate and freshly marinated figs, which I enriched with a sauce made from fig leaves, red wine, and citrus fruits. In this menu, I have included ice sorbet for all those who want to freshen up with flavours of citrus fruits and mint, which, like most herbs, comes from our small garden on the Oleander Terrace. There, my team and I carefully nurture basil, thyme, mint, rosemary, lavender, and chilli peppers, and I believe that this gives our food a unique flavour. I am proud of our homemade crackers and our own foccacia, which we serve with homemade flavoured churned butter, which is foamy and very tasty, as well as premium organic olive oil Nai 3.3 from the island of Dugi Otok, awarded with numerous quality certificates.\u201d\u00a0<\/i><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Zinfandel\u2019s Restaurant, with its modern ambience and magical Oleander Terrace offering a view of the city, is a meeting spot and premium culinary location where guests happily return.
