It nurtures its own quality, which it owes to its staff and entire team, to this day, even as an elite hotel and tourist destination of the city of Zagreb and the whole of Croatia. Always synonymous with opulence, it is the site of Zagreb&#8217;s main gatherings frequented by famous guests like Josephine Baker, Leonid Brezhnev, Charles Lindbergh, and others. After a full refurbishment, which preserved its distinctive art deco charm, it reopened its doors as even more beautiful and attractive, evidenced by the fact that it is considered a star hotel in the entire region and beyond.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>###<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><b>PR Contact, Esplanade Zagreb Hotel:\u00a0<\/b><\/div>\n<div><b>Sanda Sokol, PR &amp; Marketing Manager\u00a0<\/b><\/div>\n<div>T. +385 1 45 66 036<\/div>\n<div>E.\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:sanda.sokol@esplanade.hr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sanda.sokol@esplanade.hr<\/a><\/div>\n<div><a href=\"https:\/\/www.esplanade.hr\/hotel-blog\/989\/www.esplanade.hr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.esplanade.hr<\/a><\/div>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_separator][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The World Luxury Hotel Awards is prestigious recognition for the best in the hotel industry.
