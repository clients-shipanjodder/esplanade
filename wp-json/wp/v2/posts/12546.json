Sometimes that means raising awareness, sometimes it implies concrete help, and this year, the Esplanade Hotel is doing both. The partnership with the P.I.N.K. Life association will mark the whole of October. For the occasion,\u00a0<b>the front fa\u00e7ade of the Esplanade was illuminated this evening<\/b>, and it will remain\u00a0<b>pink until Saturday.<\/b>\u00a0This event was attended by numerous people from the public\u00a0<b>and political life of the city<\/b>\u00a0who came to support the initiative.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to data, Croatia recorded\u00a0<b>2,999 cases of breast cancer<\/b>\u00a0(143.2\/100,000 rate) in\u00a0<b>in 2019<\/b>, while\u00a0<b>722 women died in 2020<\/b>\u00a0(34.7\/100,000 rate) from this malignant disease. Breast cancer is the third most malignant cause of death in women in Croatia, after lung cancer and colorectal cancer.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">By the decision of the\u00a0<b>Government of the Republic of Croatia<\/b>, the\u00a0<b>National Breast Cancer Early Detection Programme<\/b>\u00a0was launched in 2006. Within the programme, every two years all women in the Republic of Croatia between the ages of 50 and 69 are invited to undergo a mammogram, with the aim of reducing mortality from breast cancer, detecting breast cancer in the initial stage, and improving the quality of patients\u2019 lives. Since the launch of the National Program and the introduction of mammography screening,\u00a0<b>progress has been made<\/b>\u00a0because there is an increase in the share of breast cancer cases detected in an early, localised stage and a decrease in those detected with regional and distant metastases. For the fifth year in a row, we have been recording in the Republic of Croatia a decrease in mortality from breast cancer (25%), which is the main goal of the Program.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">The importance of breast self-examination, regular mammography examinations, as well as the conducting of activities for the purpose of education and public awareness of this malignant disease, have a crucial importance for the prevention and early detection of breast cancer.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Zagreb\u2019s Esplanade Hotel<\/b>\u00a0has actively joined the P.I.N.K.

Namely,\u00a0<b>entire month of October<\/b>\u00a0at the Esplanade Hotel is dedicated to raising awareness of the importance of breast cancer prevention. All\u00a0<b>employees wear pink ribbons,<\/b>\u00a0and our popular\u00a0<b>Afternoon Tea was given a pink makeover.<\/b>\u00a0Renowned\u00a0<b>chef Ana Grgi\u0107 Tomi\u0107<\/b>\u00a0(Chef of the Year 2022 by Gault&amp;Millau) and awarded\u00a0<b>p\u00e2tissier Mirjana \u0160poljar\u00a0<\/b>joined forces and designed sweet and salty pink snacks that are served on a tiered stand with premium Ronnefeldt tea. In addition, premium cocktail master and Bar Manager\u00a0<b>Vjenceslav Madi\u0107, Master Kishoni\u00a0<\/b>has created for this occasion a series of pink cocktails such as Villa Sandi Prosecco Ros\u00e9, Rossecco, Pink gin and tonic, or Esplanade pink fizz that perfectly round off the story and overall experience. The idea of this pink story is to entice the ladies to participate, wear pink, take a selfie, and with their post and\u00a0<b>influence<\/b>\u00a0on\u00a0<b>social media encourage women to undergo early examinations.<\/b>\u00a0The Esplanade Hotel will\u00a0<b>donate 10% of the proceedings<\/b>\u00a0from the consumption of pink afternoon tea\u00a0<b>to the P.I.N.K.
