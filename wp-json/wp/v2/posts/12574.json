For the occasion,\u00a0<b>Executive Chef Ana Grgi\u0107 Tomi\u0107<\/b>, with her team of young and creative chefs, prepared before guests a series of scrumptious snacks, the smile on her face showing just how much she truly enjoys what she does. The presentation of the spring concept was attended by numerous representatives of the media, guests of Le Bistro, as well as a few famous faces and other gourmands, who were among the first to have the opportunity to taste the dishes that are from today available to guests of Le Bistro.<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>&#8220;I hope guests will really delight in my dishes this spring. I really enjoyed creating the new Le Bistro menu, I adore spring and the splendour of colours, textures, and flavours that inspired me to prepare a blend of surprising and nutritionally balanced and healthy dishes. I work closely with great local vendors who send me the best, so it was a pleasure to prepare these dishes. There was no lack of inspiration,&#8221; said\u00a0<\/i><b>t<\/b><b>he Esplanade\u2019s Executive Chef Ana Grgi\u0107 Tomi\u0107<\/b><i>\u00a0and added: &#8220;While preparing the menu, this time, too, I was guided by the sustainable principle of cooking in order to make the most of all the parts. For example, I use fillets for fish dishes, but the rest is not thrown away. Instead, we use the head and bones to cook a fine fish stock. When creating the menu, I try to get as many ingredients as possible from local family farms, while the herbs are from my garden on the Oleander Terrace, all with the desire to have home-made food and reduce harmful impact on the environment. Sardines and shrimp come from the Adriatic Sea, the lamb comes from Gorski Kotar, while I bet our goat cheese from a small farm near Zagreb.&#8221;\u00a0<\/i><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Spring is an opportunity for Ana to play with ingredients and cooking techniques, and she prepares many of them with her team in her own workshop. For example, she marinates the sardines in salt and sugar to extract moisture, and serves them with home-made parsley pesto and tomato jam, which she prepares herself. The purple potato gnocchi are handmade and come paired with home-made goat cheese and trout caviar. This time, Ana is preparing the tuna as an artsy mosaic \u2013 she starts by marinating it in salt, cutting it into strips and coating it with seaweed, then cooking it sous vide and cutting it into slices. The tuna\u2019s freshness is additionally enhanced by cucumber juice, mint, and home-grown watercress. The lightly roasted amberjack fish comes plated alongside caramelised young cabbage, while the turbot is served in an interesting combination with kale and white beans. Artichokes are cooked in herb juice and served with baby lamb.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to creative and surprising pairings, Ana paid attention to having a portion of the dishes adapted for a vegetarian diet and to those who eat according to halal standards, as well as for those who eat gluten-free. Here we should definitely highlight the legendary Esplanade \u0161trukli in their gluten-free version, which are just as tasty as those with wheat flour.\u00a0<i>&#8220;The Esplanade Hotel has always been known for its excellent service, which includes adapting to the needs and wishes of guests. I like to say that we are one of but a few restaurants that can adapt their offer to the needs and habits of guests, while our staff is familiar with the standards of different diets, which is why guests come here with confidence,&#8221;<\/i>\u00a0said\u00a0<b>Restaurant Manager Ivan Trbu\u0161i\u0107<\/b>, who has been at the forefront of Le Bistro for twenty-five years.<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">His charming and well-established team served guests, during the presentation of the new menu, a selection of excellent wines provided by the\u00a0<b>Vo\u0161tini\u0107 Klasni\u0107 Winery<\/b>.
