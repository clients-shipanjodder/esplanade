One may say that cooking is embedded in his genes. Namely, his parents and grandparents were also cooks and chefs, and he grew up cherishing a love for food from the earliest age. As a child, he spent a lot of time in the kitchen trying out new dishes with his family. Although his teenage dream was to become a football star, it never came to be. As he underlines, at the time, there was only one thing left for him &#8211; to become a top culinary chef. He started cooking in 1989, and very soon decided to leave his native Czech Republic and travel the world and learn about the culinary craft. After spending three years in Germany, he went to New Zealand, then to the USA, followed by Italy and Portugal. Instead of dreaming to work at large, famous restaurants, Chef Old\u0159ich chose smaller venues in villages, where he got to know each country&#8217;s local traditional food and learned to cook along some of the best chefs. Even today, he cherishes this principle and serves in his restaurant only traditional dishes with fresh, seasonal ingredients. Sahajd\u00e1k finally decided to return to the Czech Republic, and in 1996 started working for the Roc Ambiente Company &#8211; one of the most respectable restaurant companies in the Czech Republic. In 2003, he studied at CIA (Culinary Institute of America) in St. Helena, California. While travelling the world and researching the best gastronomic experiences, he decided it was time for Prague to get such a place of its own &#8211; a restaurant where food is prepared with the best local products and where guests are treated like friends. The owners of the Ambiente group agreed to become his business partners, and in 2006 he became co-owner of the La Degustation Boh\u00eame Bourgeoise restaurant. Chef Old\u0159ich Sahajd\u00e1k emphasises that when creating dishes, he delves deep into the history of his country and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. When creating menus, he selects traditional dishes from those countries and combines them with modern techniques, creating a superb gastronomic experience that is now recognised all over the world. For Chef Old\u0159ich Sahajd\u00e1k, only local and seasonal ingredients come into consideration, and this is supported by the fact that he approves the final menu daily, only after he knows the availability of fresh local ingredients that day. In support of his restaurant\u2019s popularity speaks the fact that there is almost no famous person who does not visit the La Degustation Boh\u00eame Bourgeoise restaurant when visiting Prague, which is certainly a confirmation of its quality and the prestige it maintains among the public. The Chef and his team are regular guest chefs at famous restaurants throughout Europe and the rest of the world &#8211; from London to Singapore. He wants to grow every day, taste different ingredients, and combine them into new flavours. His beef tartare and a sandwich with truffles are his signature dishes that have been served since the restaurant&#8217;s very opening, making him, in a way, become recognisable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The <strong>La Degustation Boh\u00eame Bourgeoise Restaurant<\/strong> is located in the heart of Prague, and is known as a place for traditional Czech cuisine with a twist. Its quality was recognised in 2012 when it was awarded a Michelin star, which it still holds today. It is one of only two restaurants in the Czech Republic awarded with this gastronomic award. Although known as a top culinary site, the restaurant cultivates a relaxed atmosphere. Visitors are encouraged to eat certain dishes with their hands, just as they would if they were having lunch or dinner at home. The chefs and personnel consider all their guests friends, and treat them as such during their visit. The restaurant seats 35 and serves five menus and 12 to 15 amuse bouches, or small snacks. The chef\u2019s custom is that each menu is unique and that the ingredients are not repeated, if we exclude the basic ones. The menu is carefully synchronised with the season, with minimal daily changes. Each dish is designed on the day of its preparation, which depends on the availability of ingredients. Chefs themselves often pick mushrooms and catch fish from local rivers and lakes, all with the aim of providing visitors with a true gastronomic experience of the Czech Republic, respecting its tradition and rich culinary history. Each dish tells its own story.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The exclusive gala dinner will take place <strong>on Wednesday, 26 April 2023, at Zinfandel&#8217;s Restaurant starting at 8 p.m.<\/strong> The evening begins with a <strong>welcome reception at the <a href=\"https:\/\/esplanade1925.hr\/en\/\">Lounge &amp; Cocktail Bar<\/a><\/strong>, and continues <strong>with a five-course gala dinner<\/strong>.
