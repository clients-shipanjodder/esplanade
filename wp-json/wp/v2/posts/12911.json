Ana&#8217;s quality, creativity, and contribution to the culinary scene have recently been recognised by a prominent community creating a list of the world&#8217;s best restaurants &#8211; La Liste Mediterranean &#8211; and named her in the &#8220;New Talent of the Year&#8221; category<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Over the course of almost four decades,\u00a0 Le Bistro has acquired cult status among numerous guests, especially the people of Zagreb, many of whom consider it their second living room, be it for the charming staff, excellent coffee and cakes, its unmissable <em>\u0161trukli<\/em>, or for the authentic atmosphere of Parisian chic. What is especially attractive in the summer months is its shaded terrace with a touch of street theatre, which, in combination with <strong>Ana&#8217;s new \u00e0 la carte concept<\/strong> and <strong>collection of premium wines and sparkling wines by the glass<\/strong>, provides a unique atmosphere for relaxation in the heart of Zagreb.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Ana&#8217;s new menu brings a variety of colours and seasonal ingredients, but also some fantastic combinations that will delight you with their arty presentation and interesting flavours inspired by summer. <em>\u201cI combined crab with a home-made smoked tomato and added a specific flavour to the dish. I have complemented scallops with mango and coconut cream, which give them an exotic touch. This time I&#8217;m serving the French speciality, roasted foie gras, with a sauce made of dried apricots and white pepper, whose flavours combine excellently. I especially took into account the eating habits of our guests, and among vegetarian dishes I would highlight gnudi made of porcini mushrooms with truffle cottage cheese and goat cheese, then a baby salad with nettle pesto and Pag cheese with the addition of pine nuts, as well as a crispy juicy croquette with zucchini and Istrian truffles that comes with zucchini and watercress carpaccio, which are currently in high season. In this menu our famous creamy risotto comes with salted carrots and smoked Italian burrata. I would especially like to single out the home-made wild garlic noodles, which come from our own production, and in combination with the smoked sardine and dried raisin pasta, they draw special attention. For all those desiring the flavours of the sea, I suggest soft monkfish cheeks in roasted tomato sauce and corn foam, or a somewhat different take on John Dory fillet that comes with black garlic crown, potato cream, and Swiss chard gel. We also smoke our juicy beef steak ourselves and serve it together with potato confit, shallot, and carrot demi-glace with the addition of nasturtium oil, while the soft veal cheeks, which are combined with roasted artichokes and burnt eggplant cream, literally melt in your mouth,\u201d said Chef Ana Grgi\u0107 Tomi\u0107 flashing a smile and once again showing how much she truly enjoys her creations.<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Here it should be noted that the creative cuisine of the experienced and charming first lady of the Esplanade&#8217;s cuisine was also noticed by the community that forms a list of the world&#8217;s best restaurants \u2013<a href=\"https:\/\/www.laliste.com\/it\/\"> <strong><em>La Liste Mediterranean<\/em><\/strong><\/a><em> &#8211; <\/em>which is how <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/esplanade.hr\/food-concept\/chef-ana-grgic\/\">Ana Grgi\u0107 Tomi\u0107<\/a> was recently awarded in the &#8220;New Talent of the Year&#8221; category<\/strong>, within the &#8220;New Talents in the Mediterranean Region&#8221; competition, which once again recognised her quality and innovation in creating signature dishes, as well as her contribution to the gastronomic scene.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In addition to appetisers and main courses, there is also an indispensable <strong>collection of exquisite desserts<\/strong> that are deserving of rounding off a lunch or dinner. &#8220;I can hardly single out any dessert, because they are all excellent, real summer desserts, but perhaps the greatest hit is the coconut crumble in combination with fresh blueberries and homemade blueberry ice cream that we make ourselves in our pastry shop. A light acacia panna cotta complemented with a juicy peach and white chocolate cream is combined with a lemon and thyme crumble that give this dessert a special Mediterranean note. Another favourite is the caramelised dough with cow&#8217;s curd cream, roasted Neretva apricots and again our home-made chamomile ice cream, as well as the roasted orange and almond sponge cake flavoured with pepper and cinnamon with roasted orange cream. Frankly, all the desserts are excellent, I believe that hardly anyone will be able to resist trying them,&#8221; added Ana.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In addition to the new \u00e0 la carte menu, Le Bistro also offers a taste-tested <strong>collection of indispensable classics <\/strong>whose popularity continues to grow &#8211; such as steak tartare, French onion soup, Caesar salad, and the famous Viennese steak with creamy potatoes.
