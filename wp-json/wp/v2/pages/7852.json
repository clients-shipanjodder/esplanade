In 2012 Ana proudly became the very first woman to lead the Esplanade\u2019s kitchen and went on to follow the tradition of crafting exceptional cuisine, placing her specific culinary touch within all her dishes.<\/p>\n<p>Ambitious flair, exceptional talent and bundles of creativity have led Ana to the most prestigious global gourmet restaurants with two Michelin stars. Here she spent valuable time perfecting her culinary skills under the leadership of famous chefs, such as<b>\u00a0Yves Mattagne<\/b>\u00a0<b>at the Sea Grill Restaurant in Brussels<\/b>\u00a0and\u00a0<b>Christian Lohse from the acclaimed Fisher&#8217;s Fritz in Berlin<\/b>.

The young Ana Grgi\u0107 prepared her risotto to the warm delight of the Riso Gallo board members thus Zinfandel&#8217;s found itself once again on the pages of this prestigious guide &#8211; the third consecutive time.<\/p>\n<p>Confirmation of this was recently best illustrated upon\u00a0<b>Prince Charles and the Duchess of Corwall\u2019s visit to Croatia<\/b>.

Each season Ana carefully creates &#8211; \u00e0 la carte menus, which pose their own set of challenges. Fundamentally it is striking a distinctive style, then using local and currently available fresh ingredients &#8211; and then from that magically create something that will provide guests with a truly unique experience of taste and smell.<\/p>\n<p>Ana&#8217;s style of food preparation can be characterized as a combination of\u00a0<b>Mediterranean and Continental<\/b>\u00a0<b>classic dishes<\/b>, prepared in a modern style. Ana occasionally plays with\u00a0<b>molecular gastronomy<\/b>, which often creates delightfully unusual combinations of flavours pleasing to the eye and palate. Ana monitors global gastronomy trends and strives to introduce them into her creations.\u00a0<b>Special attention<\/b>\u00a0is paid to the selection of top quality fresh local ingredients, and food presentation &#8211;
